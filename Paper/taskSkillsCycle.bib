	abstract="The definition of labour-force participation in the standard labour-supply model stands in sharp contrast to that used in compiling the labour-force statistics. In the labour-supply models only those supplying positive hours of work are considered to be labour-force participants. On the other hand, participation in the labour-force statistics is often defined to include not only those supplying positive hours but also those actively searching for work. This paper is an attempt to reconcile these concepts by allowing `unemployed' workers to enter a generalisation of the standard labour-supply model. This turns out to be a convenient way to enter demand-side factors directly into the determination of an individual's labour market position. The model is applied with some success to the working behaviour of married women in the UK Family Expenditure Survey.",

	abstract={We develop a business cycle model with search and matching frictions in the labor market and show that on-the-job search generates substantial amplification and propagation. Rising search by employed workers in an expansion amplifies the incentives of firms to post vacancies. By keeping job creation costs low for firms, on-the-job search amplifies exogenous shocks. In our calibration, this allows the model to generate fluctuations of unemployment, vacancies, and job-to-job transitions whose magnitudes are close to the data, and leads output to be highly autocorrelated. On-the-job search implies higher-order serial correlation that is absent from the standard search and matching model.<br><small>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)</small>},

	abstract = {Using quarterly data for the U.K. from 1993 through 2012, we document that the extent of worker reallocation across occupations or industries (a career change, in the parlance of this paper) is high and procyclical. This holds true after controlling for workers׳ previous labour market status and for changes in the composition of who gets hired over the business cycle. Our evidence suggests that a large part of this reallocation reflect excess churning in the labour market. We also find that the majority of career changes come with wage increases. During the economic expansion wage increases were typically larger for those who change careers than for those who do not. During the recession this is not true for career changers who were hired from unemployment. Our evidence suggests that understanding career changes over the business cycle is important for explaining labour market flows and the cyclicality of wage growth.}

This is important in light of the recent findings that human capital of workers is largely occupation- or industry-specific. To control for measurement error in occupation and industry coding, we develop a method that utilizes the PSID Retrospective Occupation-Industry Supplemental Data Files. We emphasize the importance of our findings for understanding a number of issues such as the changes in wage inequality, aggregate productivity, job stability, and life-cycle earnings profiles.}

	abstract = {Previous work has established that recessions involve a "cleansing" effect, so that in downturns, only high productivity jobs remain. But empirical evidence suggests job quality is procyclical: jobs created in recessions are likely to be low-paying and temporary. This paper modifies previous models by adding on-the-job search, which leads to an additional "sullying" effect. Calibration of the model suggests this offsetting sullying effect is likely to be much larger than the cleansing effect, and can account for the procyclical match quality we observe in the data.},

I propose a model where hiring is endogenously more selective during recessions, forcing some unemployed workers to search for lower-skill jobs. In accounting for the cost and cyclical incidence of occupation displacement, the model accounts for existing estimates of the present value cost of job loss during expansions and recessions, and the cost of entering the labor market during a recession.},

We further allow for skills to be accumulated when used, and eroded away when not used. We estimate the model using occupation-level measures of skill requirements based on O*NET data, combined with a worker-level panel from the NLSY79. We use the estimated model to shed light on the origins and costs of mismatch along the cognitive, manual, and interpersonal skill dimensions. Our results clearly suggest that those three types of skills are very different productive attributes.},

	abstract = {When heterogeneous workers sort into heterogeneous jobs on the labor market, `how many' and especially `which' skills and job attributes matter for this choice? Based on our theory of multi-dimensional sorting under random search (Lindenlaub, Postel-Vinay 2017), this paper first develops an empirical test of how many heterogeneity dimensions matter for sorting: If the data is well-approximated by N-dimensional worker and job types, any two workers with the same type should face the same job ladder and therefore the same job acceptance sets. Conversely, if the assumption of N-dimensional heterogeneity is not justified but instead $M>N$ dimensions matter for sorting, then approximating different M-dimensional worker types by the same N-dimensional worker type will produce job ladder heterogeneity within those N-dimensional worker types, revealing misspecification of worker's attributes. To assess the accuracy of this test, we first implement it via simulations, where we simulate data from a large class of multi-dimensional models that complies with our theory. We then apply model selection methods to regressions of employment-to-employment indicators (as a proxy for job acceptance sets) on a large set of potential skills and job attributes in order to recover the true dimensionality of worker and job characteristics. We show that the model selection methods quite accurately reveal the `true' worker and job heterogeneity that matters for sorting. We then implement this test on US data at different points in time, which at each given point delivers a set of worker and job attributes that matters for labor market sorting and allows us to construct the multivariate distributions of skills and job attributes in the data. Second, we propose an application of multi-dimensional sorting to the observed slow-down in US labor market dynamics. We estimate the search model with multi-dimensional types developed in (Lindenlaub, Postel-Vinay 2017) at different points in time, using our constructed skill and job attribute distributions as inputs for the estimation. We then use the estimated model to decompose the slow-down in UE and EE flows in the part that is driven by (i) changes in the multivariate skill and job distributions, (ii) changes in technology, and (iii) changes in search frictions.},

	abstract = {In this paper we model a job-specific shock process in the matching model of unemployment with non-cooperative wage behaviour. We obtain endogenous job creation and job destruction processes and study their properties. We show that an aggregate shock induces negative correlation between job creation and job destruction whereas a dispersion shock induces positive correlation. The job destruction process is shown to have more volatile dynamics than the job creation process. In simulations we show that an aggregate shock process proxies reasonably well the cyclical behaviour of job creation and job destruction in the United States.},
